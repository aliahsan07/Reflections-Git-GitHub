When you initialize the repository, Git doesn’t create any commits for you.  You’ll have to create the first commit yourself.
git init to initialize git repository
git status
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: a hidden folder .git is created which basically implies the current directory is a git repository
git add to add a file to staging area-- git knows this file has to be committed
If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but don’t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Staging area holds the file/s on which commit is going to be applied, working directory is the directory on which git init has been applied.
