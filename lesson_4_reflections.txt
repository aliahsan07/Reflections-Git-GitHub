When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: To share the project with other people
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A : gives greater leeway to user whenever he/she wants to pull changes.
Forking
copying others repository from github to your github without the need to pull
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: fork -> cloning other user repository on github to your account on github, clone to achieve this on local systems and branches represent different state of the commits.
git stores local copies of all the remote branches.
git fetch
fast forward merges-> when one commit is the ancestor or is reachable from the other commit, moves the label down the ancestory.
when you can reach the a branch from the other you can fast merge, that is one is reachable from another.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: we can work offline and see what differences have we made as compare to the last copy on the github, so its handy for comparison purposes.
