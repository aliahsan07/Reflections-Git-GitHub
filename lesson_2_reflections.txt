Git Errors and Warnings Solution
Should not be doing an octopus
Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together. This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an inappropriate situation.

HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.
Panic! (the 'impossible' happened)

The command Caroline types to checkout the "Revert controls" commit is git checkout b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
